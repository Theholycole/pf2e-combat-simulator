# Feat and action power in combat

Made by `node tools/feat-power.mjs` on 2026-11-05: 1990 feats and actions rated, 4953 not simulated, 6 errors.

## How it's measured

- The feat module compiles each feat with the numbers of the standard party's PC who'd take it (fighter, rogue, wizard or cleric; a class outside the party goes to the one who fights most like it), at the feat's level.
- The party fights a moderate boss (one creature 2 levels up) and a moderate group (four creatures 2 levels down), 200 fights each (at most; a feat's fights stop once its answer is clear: on average 145 an encounter here, all fights 1514, no effect 660, precise 145, about zero 67 encounters), with the feat and without it, on the same dice, on a 5-foot square grid (an open field, the sides 30 feet apart, each side's melee fighters in front and its casters two squares behind; moving out of a foe's reach provokes its Reactive Strike). Fights go to the end (no morale, no retreat).
- A fight's score is the danger scale's: the party's Hit Points lost as a share, +0.25 a PC down, +1 a PC killed, +1 a wipe.
- **Rating** is the change in levels of the foes: the score the feat saves, divided by how much the score moves when the foes are a level stronger. +0.25 means having the feat is like fighting foes a quarter of a level lower. The ± is one standard error.
- **Uses a fight** is how often the PC used it in the fights that rated it. A feat the AI never picks rates near zero even if it's good at the table.
- Verdicts: very strong ≥ 0.5, strong ≥ 0.25, good ≥ 0.1, minor > 0; "no clear effect" when within two standard errors of zero.

## Summary

- no clear effect: 1350
- hurts: 472
- good: 95
- minor: 37
- strong: 31
- very strong: 5
